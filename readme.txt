NUACID - Static Website (Multilingual)
-------------------------------------
This package contains a simple static website (HTML/CSS/JS) optimized for hosting on any web server.
Structure:
 - index.html, about.html, products.html, partners.html, news.html, contact.html
 - assets/css/style.css
 - assets/js/language.js
 - assets/images/* (placeholder images)

Notes:
1) The site default language is Vietnamese. Use the language buttons (top-right) to switch to English or Chinese.
2) Footer contact fields are left blank for you to edit directly in the HTML files.
3) To deploy:
   - Upload the entire NUACID_Website folder to your hosting (public_html or www).
   - Ensure index.html is in the root or set as default page.
4) To edit text: open the .html files and modify the content inside the <div class="lang" data-lang="..."> blocks.
5) If you want separate pages per language, create copies like index_en.html and modify links.

If you want, I can also:
 - Generate a ZIP archive ready for download.
 - Help you deploy to GitHub Pages or a typical cPanel hosting.
